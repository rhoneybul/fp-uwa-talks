<h3 id="building-a-web-service-in-haskell">Building a Web Service in Haskell</h3>
<p>Continuing on from last week, where we had a gentle introduction to using ghc and Haskell, we are going to build a simple json web service using the haskell module 'Scotty'.</p>
<h3 id="scotty">Scotty</h3>
<p>Scott is a Haskell Web Framework, which is very lightweight and simplistic to use. To install scotty on your machine, run the following command in the terminal;</p>
<pre class="{bash}"><code>honeybul@ubuntu:~$ cabal install scotty</code></pre>
<h3 id="todays-exercise">Today's Exercise</h3>
<p>Im am going to give a gentle introduction to using Scotty by building a JSON web service API, using some data we have gathered on Terrorism Incidents from 1970 to 2017. We will set up our web service to return an array of JSON Objects, with the following parameter routes;</p>
<pre class="{haskell}"><code>[&#39;GET&#39;] (&#39;/incident_by_year/:year&#39;)
  -- Returns a list of terrorism incidents in a particular year

[&#39;GET&#39;] (&#39;/incidents_by_type/:incident_type&#39;) =&gt; 
  -- Returns a list of terrorism incidents, where the string &#39;incident_type&#39; is in the &#39;type&#39; of the incident
  
[&#39;GET&#39;] (&#39;/incidents_by_location/:location) =&gt; 
  -- Returns a list of terrorism incidents, where the string &#39;location&#39; is in the &#39;location&#39; of the incident</code></pre>
