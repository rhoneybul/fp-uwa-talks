<h2 id="getting-started-with-haskell">Getting Started with Haskell</h2>
<p>Haskell is a purely functional language, and with strong static typing. The main compiler for Haskell is the Glasgow Hasell Compiler (GHC). GHC has an interactive REPL, called GHCI, which allows you to execute haskell code as well as bringing in modules. The package manager for Haskell is 'Cabal', and as you may expect, haskell modules can be installed using;</p>
<pre class="{bash}"><code>
honeybul@ubuntu:~$ cabal install &lt;package-name&gt; 
</code></pre>
<p>Some of the benefits of Haskell is that it is very difficult to have side effect in programs developed with haskell, as well as the type system, which has type inference and lazy evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="first-impressions">First Impressions</h3>
<p>Haskell is a very difficult language to get your head around. I found that starting out was quite difficult, as there are few resources which give a gentle introduction to getting up and running writing fairly trivial programs.</p>
<p>Some of the things that have helped me, are having a basic understanding of the IO monad, and trying to use ghci as much as possible.</p>
